# Turn your storefront into an app landing page

Your store (conversionoptimizer.myshopify.com) is currently showing the default theme with "Browse our latest products" and a product catalog. You're **selling the Conversion Optimizer app**, not physical products. Use the steps below to turn the homepage into an app landing page.

---

## 1. Edit the theme (Customize)

1. In **Shopify Admin** go to **Online Store → Themes**.
2. Click **Customize** on your current theme (e.g. Horizon).
3. You're now in the **theme editor** on your **home page**.

---

## 2. Replace the hero section

Find the **hero / banner** section at the top (the big image with "Browse our latest products").

- **Heading (main title):**  
  `Conversion Optimizer — The app that helps your store sell more`

- **Subheading / description:**  
  `We analyze your Shopify store and show you what's wrong. Product pages, trust signals, theme. Get a clear list of fixes so your store converts better and starts selling.`

- **Button text:**  
  `Get the app` or `Try it free`

- **Button link:**  
  Your app's install URL, e.g.  
  `https://apps.shopify.com/conversion-optimizer`  
  (Use your real App Store listing URL from Partners. If the app isn’t listed yet, use your Partners test-install URL or a “Contact us” page.)

- **Background image:**  
  Optionally replace the default image with a simple branded image or a solid color so it doesn’t look like a product shop.

---

## 3. Remove or replace the "Products" section

- **Option A — Remove:** In the theme editor, select the **Products** section and remove it (or hide it) so the homepage doesn’t show a product catalog.
- **Option B — Replace:** If the theme allows, replace it with a **custom section** or **rich text** block and paste the content below.

**Replace-with copy (if you add a text/HTML section):**

**Headline:**  
`Why store owners use Conversion Optimizer`

**Body:**  
`We scan your store and tell you exactly what’s wrong: weak product pages, missing trust signals, theme and pricing issues. You get a prioritized list of fixes—no guesswork. Fix the problems, get more popular, start selling. Plans from $9/mo. Cancel anytime.`

**Button:**  
`Get the app` → (same app URL as above)

---

## 4. Optional: Simplify navigation

In the theme editor, check **Header / Navigation**:

- Keep **Home** and **Contact** (or “Support”).
- Remove or rename **Catalog** if it points to products. You can replace it with **Get the app** (link to your app URL) or **Features** (anchor or page about the app).

---

## 5. Optional: Dedicated “App” or “Features” page

Create a page that explains the app (e.g. **App** or **How it works**):

- What Conversion Optimizer does (analyze store, find problems, give fixes).
- Benefits (sell more, get popular, clear action list).
- Pricing (Starter $9, Growth $19, Pro $29).
- CTA: **Get the app** (link to App Store or install URL).

Add this page to the main menu so the store clearly leads to the app, not to products.

---

## Quick checklist

- [ ] Hero: title + subtitle about the **app**, not “latest products”.
- [ ] Hero button: “Get the app” / “Try it free” → app URL.
- [ ] Products section: removed or replaced with app benefits.
- [ ] Nav: no “Catalog” or product-focused link unless you want it; add “Get the app” or “Features”.
- [ ] (Optional) “App” or “How it works” page + link in menu.

After saving, your storefront will present Conversion Optimizer as the product (the app for store owners), not a product catalog.
