# Fix "Products" in the header showing nothing

Your store is an **app landing page**, not a product catalog. The header menu still has a **Products** (or **Catalog**) link that goes to your store's product collection—which is empty, so the page shows nothing.

## Fix in the theme editor

1. In the **theme editor** (Customize), in the **left sidebar** click **Header**.
2. Find **Menu** or **Main menu** (the navigation that shows Home, Products, Contact, etc.).
3. Click **Main menu** (or the menu name) to open the menu editor.
4. **Remove** the "Products" or "Catalog" link:
   - Click the **Products** item → remove or delete it.
5. **Optional:** Replace it with a useful link:
   - **Get the app** → link to `https://apps.shopify.com/conversion-optimizer`
   - **Features** or **How it works** → link to your home page `/#what-it-does` or a page you create
   - Or leave the menu with just **Home** and **Contact** (if you have a contact page).
6. **Save**.

After that, the header won't send people to an empty products page.
