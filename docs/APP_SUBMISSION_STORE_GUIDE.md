# Completing your app submission — section by section

Use this guide to fill out **Partners → Conversion Optimizer → App submission** (the “Completing your app submission” flow). Each section below matches the sidebar; copy-paste the content where indicated.

**Replace before you start:**
- `YOUR_APP_URL` → your backend URL, e.g. `https://conversion-optimizer-api-production.up.railway.app` (no trailing slash)
- `YOUR_SUPPORT_EMAIL` → e.g. `support@yourdomain.com` (must not contain “Shopify” or “Example”)

---

## 1. Basic app information

| Field | What to enter |
|-------|----------------|
| **App name** | `Conversion Optimizer` (20/30 characters — already set) |

If there are more fields here (e.g. short summary), use:

- **Short summary (if asked):**  
  `Analyzes your store and gives a prioritized list of conversion fixes. Scan once, fix what matters.`

Save before moving on.

---

## 2. App store listing content

### App introduction (max 100 characters)

**Instructions:** Two brief sentences. Summarize what the app does and the main benefit (sales, getting found). No keyword stuffing or generic fluff.

**Use this (99 characters):**

```
We show exactly what's wrong with your store. Fix it and get found—then convert visitors and sell more.
```

**Alternatives (pick one if you prefer):**

- `One scan. A clear list of fixes. Get your store found, convert better, and start selling.` (78 chars)
- `Your store could be selling more. We show what to fix so customers find you and buy.` (86 chars)

---

### App details

**Instructions:** Explain how the app solves problems and helps merchants. Be clear, concise, factual. Full sentences. Focus on: what makes it unique, why merchants like it, what problem it solves, how it helps (sales, discoverability).

**Use this:**

```
Conversion Optimizer solves a simple problem: stores that aren't selling often don't know why. We run one scan of your products, theme, and trust signals and give you a prioritized list of what to fix—not a vague dashboard, but specific actions (weak product pages, missing guarantees, layout issues) that hurt conversion and make it harder for customers to find and trust you.

Merchants get a single list sorted by impact. You fix the high-priority items first, then medium and low. Each recommendation explains what's wrong and why it matters, so you can improve how your store shows up and converts. The result is a store that's easier to find, builds trust, and turns visitors into sales.
```

**Shorter option (if there's a tight character limit):**

```
Stores that aren't selling usually have fixable issues—weak product pages, missing trust signals, or a theme that doesn't convert. Conversion Optimizer runs one scan and gives you a prioritized list of what to change. You see exactly what's wrong and why, so you can get your store found, build trust, and sell more. No guesswork; just a clear list of fixes that help you convert visitors into customers.
```

---

### Tagline / Subtitle (~70 characters)

```
Prioritized conversion recommendations for your store. Scan once, fix what matters.
```
*(67 characters)*

### Short description (search / preview, ~260 characters)

```
Conversion Optimizer analyzes your products, trust signals, and theme and gives you a prioritized list of changes. Run a store scan, then work through recommendations by severity. Filter by impact, export to CSV. Plans from $19/month.
```
*(~175 characters — under 260)*

### Full description (main listing body)

Copy the block below into the full description field:

```
Get a clear list of conversion fixes, not a dashboard you won't use.

Conversion Optimizer runs a one-time scan of your store and returns a prioritized list of recommendations. Each item has a severity (high, medium, low), a clear rationale, and—where we can estimate it—expected impact on conversion. You get actionable next steps, not vague tips.

What we analyze
• Product titles, descriptions, images, and variants
• Trust signals: guarantees, shipping, returns, contact
• Theme blocks and layout on product and global pages
• Pricing and compare-at consistency

What you get
• A single list of recommendations, sorted by impact
• Filter by severity so you can tackle high-impact items first
• Export to CSV for your team or devs
• Rationales that explain what to change and why

Plans
• Growth ($19/mo) — Store scan, recommendations, filter by severity, export CSV. Best for growing stores.
• Pro ($29/mo) — Everything in Growth, plus 24/7 priority support. For teams and high-volume stores.

No per-scan fees. Cancel anytime from your Shopify billing.
```

Upload 3–5 images (PNG or JPEG). Suggested order:

1. **App home** — Logo, shop name, “Plans” (Growth $19, Pro $29), “Run scan” and “View recommendations” buttons.
2. **Run scan page** — “What we analyze” list and “Start scan” button.
3. **Recommendations page** — Summary (e.g. X high, Y medium, Z low), a few recommendation cards with title, category, rationale.
4. **(Optional)** Export CSV or filter UI.

Use real or anonymized store data. Keep UI clean; no stock photos.

---

### Video or hero image (app “ad”)

Use **one** of these so your listing feels professional and makes merchants want to try the app.

**Option A — Hero image (no video)**  
- **File:** `docs/assets/conversion-optimizer-app-listing-hero.png` — clean, professional ad-style image: “Fix your store. Get found. Sell more.” with Conversion Optimizer branding (green logo). Use it as your **first image** in the listing so it shows like an app ad.
- **Specs:** PNG or JPEG. If Partners asks for size, 1200×630 or 1920×1080 (16:9) are safe. The provided image is suitable for listing or social.

**Option B — Short video (30–60 seconds)**  
- **Specs:** MP4, 16:9. Keep it simple: no music overload, clear captions or voiceover. Show the app, not a long intro.
- **Script (voiceover or on-screen text):**
  1. **0–10 s:** “Your store could be selling more. You just don’t know what’s wrong.”
  2. **10–20 s:** “Conversion Optimizer runs one scan of your products, theme, and trust signals.”
  3. **20–35 s:** “You get a clear list of what to fix—prioritized by impact. Fix the right things first and get found.”
  4. **35–45 s:** “Filter by severity, export to CSV. No guesswork—just a list that helps you convert and sell.”
  5. **45–55 s:** “Conversion Optimizer. One scan. Clear fixes. Start selling.” [Show app name / Install CTA if possible.]

**What to show in the video:**  
- Quick shot of app home (logo, “Run scan”, “View recommendations”).  
- Run scan screen → “Start scan”.  
- Recommendations list with a few cards (high/medium/low).  
- Optional: filter or export. End on app name and “Install” or “Try it”.

**Tone:** Professional, simple, benefit-led (get found, convert, sell more). No hype; focus on the outcome.

In the pricing section, enter:

| Plan   | Price | Billing  |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Growth | $19   | Monthly  |
| Pro    | $29   | Monthly  |

**Summary text (if there’s a field):**

- **Growth** — Store scan, prioritized recommendations, filter by severity, export CSV. Best for growing stores.

---

## 4. App discovery content

| Field | What to enter |
|-------|----------------|
| **Category** | **Marketing - Other** (“Apps related to other marketing methods”). If you search “conversion” or “optimization” and see a closer match, you can pick that instead. |
| **Tags / keywords** | conversion, CRO, conversion rate optimization, store audit, recommendations, product page, trust signals |

---

## 5. Install requirements

If the form asks “Does your app require any special setup or permissions?”:

- **No special requirements.** Merchants install from the App Store, approve OAuth and billing when prompted, then run a scan.

If there’s a “Requirements” or “Prerequisites” text box, you can leave it empty or add:

```
None. Works with all Shopify stores. For recommendations that add theme blocks (e.g. trust badges), Online Store 2.0 themes are required; we’ll note that in the app.
```

---

## 6. Services or devices your app integrates with

**What to enter:** List only services or devices that merchants would care about. Conversion Optimizer does **not** connect to third-party CRMs, ad platforms, or email tools—it works entirely within Shopify.

**Paste this:**

```
Shopify Admin (embedded app)
Shopify API (products, themes, shop data for store scan and recommendations)
Shopify Billing (subscription plans)
Shopify Online Store / Themes (theme app extension — app blocks for trust, FAQ, etc. on compatible themes)
```

**Shorter option (if the field is a single line or dropdown):**

- **Shopify** — We use the Shopify Admin, API (products, themes, shop), Billing API, and theme app extensions. No other external services or devices.

If the form has **checkboxes** (e.g. “Shopify”, “Google”, “Facebook”), select **Shopify** only. If it asks for “Other services”, you can leave it empty or write “None.”

---

## 7. Tracking information

If the form asks whether the app uses analytics or tracking:

- If you **do not** send merchant or visitor data to third-party analytics, select **No** or “My app doesn’t use tracking” (or equivalent).
- If you **do** use analytics (e.g. error reporting, usage stats), disclose it and add a short sentence (e.g. “We use [service] for error reporting and usage metrics; see our Privacy policy”).

Your app has a Privacy policy at `YOUR_APP_URL/privacy` — ensure it matches what you declare here.

---

## 8. Contact information

| Field | What to enter |
|-------|----------------|
| **Support / contact email** | `YOUR_SUPPORT_EMAIL` (must not contain “Shopify” or “Example”) |
| **Support URL (if asked)** | `YOUR_APP_URL/support` |
| **Privacy policy URL** | `YOUR_APP_URL/privacy` |
| **Refund policy URL** | `YOUR_APP_URL/refund` |

Example:  
Support URL: `https://conversion-optimizer-api-production.up.railway.app/support`  
Privacy: `https://conversion-optimizer-api-production.up.railway.app/privacy`  
Refund: `https://conversion-optimizer-api-production.up.railway.app/refund`

---

Reviewers need to install and test the app. Provide:

**Test store (if requested):**

- Create a **development store** in Partners (or use an existing one).
