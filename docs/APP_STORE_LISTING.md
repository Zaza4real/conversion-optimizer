## Full description (main listing body)

**Get a clear list of conversion fixes, not a dashboard you won’t use.**

Conversion Optimizer runs a one-time scan of your store and returns a prioritized list of recommendations. Each item has a severity (high, medium, low), a clear rationale, and—where we can estimate it—expected impact on conversion. You get actionable next steps, not vague tips.

**What we analyze**
- Product titles, descriptions, images, and variants  
- Trust signals: guarantees, shipping, returns, contact  
- Theme blocks and layout on product and global pages  
- Pricing and compare-at consistency  

**What you get**
- A single list of recommendations, sorted by impact  
- Filter by severity so you can tackle high-impact items first  
- Export to CSV for your team or devs  
- Rationales that explain what to change and why  

**Plans**
- **Starter** ($9/mo) — Store scan, recommendations, filter by severity, export CSV.  
- **Growth** ($19/mo) — Everything in Starter. Best for growing stores.  
- **Pro** ($29/mo) — Everything in Growth. For teams and high-volume stores.  

No per-scan fees. Cancel anytime from your Shopify billing.

## Support / FAQ (suggested)

**How does the scan work?**  
You run a scan from the app. We analyze your products and theme (via the Shopify API) and generate a list of recommendations. The list appears under “View recommendations” and stays until you run a new scan.

**What’s the difference between the plans?**  
All plans include the same core features: store scan, recommendations, filter by severity, and CSV export. Higher tiers are for stores that want more headroom or team use; feature parity keeps it simple.

**Can I cancel?**  
Yes. Cancel from your Shopify Admin billing page. You keep access until the end of the current billing period.
